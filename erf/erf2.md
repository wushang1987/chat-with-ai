# What is receivables finance?

Receivables finance, or receivables financing, is a trade finance method businesses can use to receive funding matching the amounts owed to it by its customers in outstanding invoices. These amounts are known as [trade receivables](https://taulia.com/glossary/what-are-trade-receivables/) or accounts receivable. By financing its receivables, a business can receive payments earlier, meaning it can invest in business growth and innovation.

应收账款融资，或应收账款筹资，是一种贸易融资方式，企业可利用该方式获得与客户在未付发票中所欠金额相匹配的资金。这些金额被称为[贸易应收账款](https://taulia.com/glossary/what-are-trade-receivables/)或应收账款。通过对其应收账款进行融资，企业可以更早地收到款项，这意味着它可以投资于业务增长和创新。

Receivables finance is also known as accounts receivable financing. A business using accounts receivable financing sells some, or all, of its outstanding invoices to a third party known as the funder or financer.

应收账款融资也被称为应收账款筹资。采用应收账款筹资的企业会将其部分或全部未结清发票出售给被称为出资人或融资方的第三方。

This effectively means they receive early payment on those invoices. Although some methods incur a fee, receivables financing can give businesses a working capital boost that they can use to fuel growth.

这实际上意味着他们提前收到了这些发票的款项。尽管有些方式会产生费用，但应收账款融资可以为企业提供营运资金，助力企业发展。

“fuel growth” 字面可理解为“为增长提供动力”，是一个常用的经济或商业领域表达。

它指的是通过某种方式（如投资、技术创新、政策支持、市场需求等）推动事物（通常是经济、企业、行业等）实现增长。比如，“科技创新为经济增长提供动力（Technological innovation fuels economic growth）”，这里的“fuel growth”就强调了某种因素对增长的驱动作用。

## Types of receivables finance

There are several different types of receivables financing options open to businesses, including:

- **Factoring:** Factoring is a financing method that involves a company selling its receivables to a third party, known as the factor. Typically, the company will receive between 70% and 90% of the value of the chosen receivables from the factor to begin with. The factor will then collect payment from the company’s customers at maturity and will send the company the remaining payment (minus a fee). Factoring is not to be confused with [reverse factoring](https://taulia.com/glossary/what-is-reverse-factoring/) or supply chain finance, in which the buyer initiates an early payment program for its suppliers.
- 保理：保理是一种融资方式，即公司将其应收账款出售给被称为保理商的第三方。通常，公司一开始会从保理商那里收到所选应收账款价值 70%至 90%的款项。然后，保理商将在到期时从公司客户处收取款项，并将剩余款项（扣除手续费后）支付给公司。保理不应与反向保理或供应链金融混淆，在反向保理或供应链金融中，是由买方为其供应商启动提前付款计划。

- **Invoice discounting:** Invoice discounting is a similar technique to factoring, with the main difference being that the company remains responsible for chasing up payment from customers As such, invoice discounting tends to take place confidentially, with the company’s customers not necessarily being aware that invoice discounting is being used.

发票贴现：发票贴现是一种与保理类似的技术，主要区别在于公司仍负责向客户追讨款项。因此，发票贴现往往是秘密进行的，公司的客户不一定知道正在使用发票贴现。

### 发票贴现（Invoice discounting）解析

发票贴现是一种与保理（factoring）类似的融资方式，核心区别在于：**企业需自行负责向客户催收账款**，而非由提供融资的机构承担催收责任。

由于催收工作仍由企业自身完成，这种方式通常以**保密形式进行**——客户未必知晓企业通过发票贴现获取了资金，从而避免影响企业与客户的直接关系。

简言之，它本质是企业将未到期的发票债权提前变现以获得现金流，但保留了与客户的应收账款管理权责，保密性较强。

- **Asset-based lending:** Whereas invoice factoring involves the sale of receivables, asset-based lending (ABL) enables companies to secure loans based on assets such as accounts receivable. ABL can also be secured by using other assets as collateral, such as inventory or equipment.
- 基于资产的贷款：发票保理涉及应收账款的出售，而基于资产的贷款（ABL）使公司能够凭借应收账款等资产获得贷款。ABL 也可以通过使用其他资产（如库存或设备）作为抵押品来获得担保。

The term ‘accounts receivable financing’, or ‘[AR financing](https://taulia.com/glossary/what-is-accounts-receivable-ar-financing/)’, is also sometimes used, although this means different things to different people. In some cases, accounts receivable financing is used as a synonym for receivables financing. Others may use it as another term for factoring, or to describe a type of asset-based lending.

## How receivables finance works

When companies sell goods or services to their customers, they often do so by extending credit, meaning that their customers do not need to pay until a date in the future. This benefits the customer, but for suppliers that are not cash rich, this type of arrangement can cause cash flow issues that make it difficult to fulfill customer orders or invest in business growth in the immediate term.

Receivables finance can enable companies to overcome this shortfall. By enabling early payment of invoices before their due date, companies utilizing receivables finance can reduce the delay between purchasing raw materials and receiving payment from customers. They may also be better placed to invest in R&D, innovation and expansion.

### Choosing the right arrangement

Firstly, there are a number of considerations to think about when it comes to choosing the right receivables finance arrangement for a particular company’s needs. The company will need to consider various questions, including:

- **Recourse or non-recourse?** Receivables financing techniques like factoring may take place on a recourse or non-recourse basis. In a non-recourse arrangement, the financer takes on most of the risk if the company’s customers fail to pay their invoices. If the arrangement is on a recourse basis, the company will remain responsible for any issues with non-payment.
- **Sale of receivables or loan?** An important distinction where receivables finance is concerned is whether an arrangement constitutes a true sale of receivables to a financier, or a loan which is secured against the company’s receivables.
- **Confidential or disclosed arrangement?** If a facility is confidential, the company’s customers will not be made aware of the arrangement. If it is non-confidential or disclosed, customers will be informed that financing is taking place. Some companies won’t want their customers to be aware that they are carrying out receivables financing, which may affect the type of arrangement chosen.

### Receivables finance process

To take factoring as an example, the receivables finance process may go like this:

- Seller sells goods to buyer
- Seller issues an invoice to the buyer
- Seller sells the invoice to the factor
- Factor pays seller a cash advance of 70%-90% of the value of the invoice
- Buyer pays the invoice
- Factor sends the balance to the seller with fees deducted.

## Buyer-initiated programs

While receivables financing structures like factoring are initiated by the company selling goods, buyers can also put in place structures that enable their suppliers to finance their receivables.

For example, a company can adopt a [supply chain finance](https://taulia.com/platform/payables/supply-chain-finance/) program (also known as reverse factoring). In this case, the buyer enables suppliers to access early payment from a bank or other finance provider, with the cost of funding based on the buyer’s credit rating instead of the supplier’s. This type of solution can unlock working capital for both the buyer and supplier while strengthening supplier relationships.

[Dynamic discounting](https://taulia.com/platform/payables/dynamic-discounting/) is another form of early payment program that is initiated by the buyer. Instead of asking a finance provider to pay invoices early, the company uses its own surplus cash to fund the program by offering suppliers the opportunity to take [early payment](https://taulia.com/platform/suppliers/early-payment/) in return for a discount. In this way, the buyer can earn a risk-free return on their own cash, while giving suppliers access to affordable financing.
